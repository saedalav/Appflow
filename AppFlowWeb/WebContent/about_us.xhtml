        <div class="wrapper">
        <p class="pad_bot2" style="font-size:20px; line-height: 2em;">Appflow is a Web application that enables its users to use BPMN 2.0, Activiti 
       	 Engine, and JSF framework to build powerful java workflow-based web application without the overhead that is involved in integrating these 3rd party libraries. 
        </p>
		<p class="pad_bot2" style="font-size:20px; line-height: 2em;">
		 The application works by providing users with
		 a sample eclipse environment in which, all environment initial configuration and required 3rd party
		 libraries are provided. After that, the application is able to create JSF based forms (front end and back end) 
		 that can be used to feed Activiti Engine for Activiti User tasks. The application does so by asking the user the number of forms required, 
		 the number and type of variables in each form, and whether back end code generation, front end code generation, or both is needed. 
		 The user is then able to follow provided steps in the application to insert these forms into their environment. 
		</p>
		<p class="pad_bot2" style="font-size:20px; line-height: 2em;">
			The application also provides extra functionalities such as providing user with Activiti Database Scripts for the selected database
